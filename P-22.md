### 22. What are classes and objects in C++? Provide an example.

##### 1. Classes :- 
A class is a user-defined data type that acts as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods (member functions) that operate on these attributes.

##### Syntax :-
```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    // Data members (attributes)
    // Member functions (methods)
};
```

##### 2. Objects :-
An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created. Objects allow access to the classes attributes and methods.

##### Syntax :-
```cpp
ClassName objectName;
```


##### Example of Classes & Objects :-
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Class
class Classroom {
public:
    
    string Block;    // Attributes (data members)
    int TotalStudent;

    
    void displayDetails()       // Method (member function)
    {
        cout << " Block - " << Block << endl;
        cout << " TotalStudent - " << TotalStudent << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating an object 
    Classroom C1;

    // Accessing and setting attributes using the object
    C1.Block ='A';
    C1.TotalStudent = (45);

    // Calling the method using the object
    C1.displayDetails();

    return 0;
}
```
