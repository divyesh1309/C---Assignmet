## 3. Explain the steps involved in setting up a C++ development environment.

##### Choose a Compiler :- 
A compiler translates C++ code into machine code that the computer can execute.

1. GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) : Open-source compiler Available for Windows, Linux and macOS.
2. MinGW : A Windows version of GCC.
3. Clang : Modern compiler with advanced features. 
4. Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) : Comes with Visual Studio.

##### Install a C++ Compiler :-
Windows (Using MinGW) : Download MinGW from the official site or via a package manager like MSYS2. Install MinGW and add its bin directory to your PATH environment variable.


##### Install a Text Editor or IDE :-

Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor suited for C++ development. Popular choices include:

Visual Studio (Windows): Full-featured IDE with advanced debugging tools.

Eclipse CDT: Eclipse IDE with C++ Development Tooling plugin.

Code::Blocks: Lightweight and beginner-friendly IDE. CLion: Feature-rich IDE from JetBrains (requires subscription or free student license).

Visual Studio Code: Lightweight text editor with extensions for C++.

#####  Set Up Debugging Tools :- 

Most IDEs include built-in debugging tools, but ensure debugging support is configured

Visual Studio: Comes with a powerful debugger.

GDB (GNU Debugger): Works well with GCC and is commonly used on Linux and macOS.

LLDB: Works with Clang.

##### Configure the Environment :-

Set Environment Variables:

Add the compiler's bin directory to the systemâ€™s PATH (if necessary). For example, for GCC, add the path to gcc.exe or g++ to your PATH.
Install Extensions (for text editors like VS Code): C++ IntelliSense, Syntax Highlighting, and Debugging extensions.
