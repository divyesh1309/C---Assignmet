#### 13. What is a function in C++? Explain the concept of function declaration, definition, and calling.


##### What is Functione ?
A function is a set of statements that takes input, does some specific computation, and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together to make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call this function. In simple terms, a function is a block of code that runs only when it is called.


##### 1. Functione Declaration :- 
Introduces the function to the compiler, specifying its name, return type, and parameters. Allows the function to be used before its definition in the code.


##### 2. Functione Definition :- 
Contains the actual implementation of the function. Defines what the function does when it is called.

##### 3. Functione call :-
a function call means where the compiler start running code inside function and after running all code of funciton compiler return back to that postion where function called.


###### Functione calling Syntax :- 
```cpp
functionName(argument1, argument2, ...);
```
