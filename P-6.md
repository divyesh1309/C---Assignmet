## 6. Explain the difference between implicit and explicit type conversion in C++.

###### Type casting is a concept in programming where you change the data type of a variable from one type to another. It's like changing a piece of clay from one shape to another.


Two types of type casting implicit and explicit :

1. Implicit :-
Automatically performed by the compiler when a value of one type is assigned to a variable of another compatible type.

2. Explicit :-
Performed by the programmer using type casting to explicitly convert one type to another.

#### Example:-

``` cpp

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main () {

    int num1 = 10;
    float num2 = 5.22;

    //explicit type conversions
    cout<<"Explicit type conversions : ";
    cout<<(int)num2<<endl;      
    cout<<(float)num1<<endl;     
    
    int c = 'D';
    char num = 89;

    //Implicit type conversions
    cout<<"Implicit type conversions : ";
    cout<< c <<endl;
    cout<< num <<endl;

    return 0;
}
```
