#### 14. What is the scope of variables in C++? Differentiate between local and global scope.


##### Local variables :-

1. They are only accessible within the block in which they are declared.
2. Local variables do not exist outside the block in which they are declared, i.e. they can not be accessed or used outside that block.
3. They are typically used for temporary storage or only relevant data within a specific context.


##### Global variables :-
1. Global variables are declared outside of any function or block of code, usually at the top of a program or in a separate file.
2. Global variables retain their value throughout the lifetime of the program unless explicitly modified or reset.
3. They are accessible from any part of the program, including within functions, loops, or other blocks of code.

Local varialble accessible only in the function where it`s declared where global variable is accessible in whole program that different of local and global variable.
