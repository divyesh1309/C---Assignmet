## 8. Explain the purpose and use of constants and literals in C++.

#### Constants :- 
Constants are fixed values that cannot be changed during the program's execution. They ensure that certain values remain consistent throughout the program

1. In C++, they are typically declared using the const keyword. When you declare a constant, you specify its data type and give it a name.
2. You can define constants of various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more.
3. Constants are often used to make code more readable, and self-documenting, and to prevent accidental changes to important values.
4. Constants are evaluated at compile-time, and their values are replaced directly in the code.

##### Example :-
```cpp
const int MAX = 100;
define PI 3.14
```


#### literals :- 
Literals are fixed values directly used in the code. They represent constants like numbers, characters, and strings. 

##### Literals type :- 
1. Integer Literals
2. Floating-Point Literals
3. Character Literals
4. String Literals
5. Boolean Literals
6. Null Pointer Literal

##### Example :-

```cpp
int decimal = 42;   // Decimal integer literal  
int hex = 0x2A;     // Hexadecimal integer literal
double decimalNum = 3.14;  // Decimal floating-point literal
double exponentNum = 6.02e23;  // Exponential floating-point literal
char ch = 'A';       // Character literal 'A'
char newline = '\n';  // Character literal for newline
const char* greeting = "Hello"; // String literal
bool isTrue = true;
bool isFalse = false;
```
