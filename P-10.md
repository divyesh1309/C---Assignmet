#### 10. What is the difference between for, while, and do-while loops in C++?

##### 1. For loop :-
The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It combines initialization, condition checking, and increment/decrement in a single line.The loop variable (variable) takes the value of each item in the sequence during each iteration.

###### For loop Syntax:
``` cpp

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to execute
}
```
##### Example :- 
```cpp
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) 
    {
        cout << i << endl;
    }
    return 0;
```

##### 2. While loop :-  
While loop Itâ€™s important to make sure that the condition eventually becomes false; otherwise, the loop will run indefinitely, resulting in an infinite loop.

###### While loop Syntax:
```cpp
while (condition) 
{
    // Code to execute
}
```
##### Example :- 
```cpp
    int i = 1;
    while (i <= 5) 
    {
        cout << i << endl;
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
```

##### 3. Do-while loop :-
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but with one key difference: it guarantees that the block of code will execute at least once before checking the condition.The do-while loop body runs once even if the condition is false initially.

###### Do-While loop Syntax:
```cpp
do 
{
    // Code to execute
} while (condition);
```
##### Example :-
```cpp
 int i = 1;
    do 
    {
        cout << i << endl;
        i++;
    } while (i <= 5);
    return 0;
```

|Feature|for Loop|while Loop|do-while Loop|
|--------|--------|---------|--------------|
|Condition Check|Before each iteration.	|Before each iteration.	|After each iteration.|
|Guaranteed Execution	|No, if condition is false initially.	|No, if condition is false initially.	|Yes, executes at least once.|
|Usage	|Best for known iteration count. |Best when condition depends on external input.	|Best when loop must execute at least once.|
|Readability|Combines initialization, condition, and increment in one line.	|Separate initialization and increment.	|Similar to while but condition after loop.|
