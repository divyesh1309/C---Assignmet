## 5.   What are the different data types available in C++? Explain with examples.

#### C++ following this datatype : 

1. Primary data type
2. Derived data types   
3. User-defined data types

##### 1. Primary data type :- 
These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables.

##### Example :-
```cpp
int Number = 10;
char Char = 'D';
bool isTrue = true;
float Float = 3.14;
double Double = 7385263291;
```

##### 2. Derived data types  :-
Derived data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types.

##### Example :-
```cpp
// this is function
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

//this is pointer
int num = 10;
int *ptr = &num;

//this is array
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```


##### 3. User-defined data types :-
Abstract or User-Defined data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure.

##### Example :-
```cpp
// Class 
class Student {
public:
string name;
int rollNo;

void display() {
    cout << "Name :- " << name << endl;
    cout << "Roll No :- " << rollNo << endl;
}
};

// Structure 
struct Person {
string name;
int age;
};

Person p1 = {"Divyesh", 18};
```
