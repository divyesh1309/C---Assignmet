### 24. What is encapsulation in C++? How is it achieved in classes?

Encapsulation is a key concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves bundling data (attributes) and functions (methods) into a single unit called a class while restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

##### Two Important property of Encapsulation :- 

1. Data Protection :- Encapsulation protects the internal state of an object by keeping its data members private. 
2. Information Hiding :- Encapsulation hides the internal implementation details of a class from external code. Only the public interface of the class is accessible, providing abstraction and simplifying the usage of the class while allowing the internal implementation to be modified without impacting external code.


##### Access Modifiers :
1. Public: Public access specifier means that the member function or data member can be accessed by any code. 
2. Private: Private access specifier means that the member function or data member can only be accessed by other member functions of the same class.
3. Protected: A protected access specifier means that the member function or data member can be accessed by other member functions of the same class or by derived classes.

##### Getter and Setter Functions :
Used to provide controlled access to private data members. If you want others to read or modify the value of a private member, you can provide public getter and setter methods.


##### Example :-
```cpp
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

class BankAccount
{
private:
     string depositor;
int accountNum;
    string accountType;
    int balance;

public:

	BankAccount() 
	{
        depositor="Chudasama Divyesh";
        accountNum=15739;
        accountType="Saving";
        balance=15000;
	}

    void addBalance()
    {
        int add;
        cout << "Enter amount to deposit - ";
        cin >>add;
        balance = balance + add;
        cout << "AMOUNT DEPOSITED\n";
    }
    void withdraw()
    {
        int withdraw;
        cout << "Enter amount to withdraw - ";
        cin >> withdraw;
        balance = balance - withdraw;
        cout << "AMOUNT withdrawed\n";
    }
    void showcustomer()
    {

        cout << " \nDepositor name  :- " << depositor << endl;
        cout << " Acount  type  :- " << accountType  << endl;
        cout << " Total balance  :- " << balance << endl;
    }
};
	

int main() 
{
	BankAccount bank;
    do
    {
        int choice;
        cout << "\n1. Deposite amount :- " << endl;
        cout << "2. WITHDRAW amount :- " << endl;
        cout << "3. SHOW BALANCE :- " << endl;
        cout << "4. EXIT! " << endl;

        cout << "ENTER YOUR CHOICE - ";
        cin >> choice;
        if (choice==4)
        {
            cout << "VISIT AGAIN";
            break;
        }
        switch (choice)
        {
        case 1:
            bank.addBalance();
            break;
        case 2:
            bank.withdraw();
            break;
        case 3:
            bank.showcustomer();
            break;
        default:
            cout << "Wrong Input!";
            break;
        }


    } while (1);
    
	return 0;
}
