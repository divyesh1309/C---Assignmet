#### 17. What are arrays in C++? Explain the difference between single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

###### :-  An array can be defined as a group or collection of similar kinds of elements or data items that are stored together in contiguous memory spaces.

##### Types of Arrays in C++ :- 
1. Single-Dimensional Array (1D Array)
2. Multi-Dimensional Arrays
3. Multi-Dimensional Array (3D Array)


##### Explain the difference between single-dimensional and multi dimensional arrays :


|Basis|single-dimensional|multi dimensional arrays|
|------------------|---------------|---------------|
|Definition	|Store a single list of the element of a similar data type.	|Store a ‘list of lists’ of the element of a similar data type.|
|Declaration	|The declaration varies for different programming language:For C++, datatypevariable_name[row]For Java, datatype [] variable_name= new datatype[row]	|The declaration varies for different programming language:For C++, datatype variable_name[row][column]For Java, datatype [][] variable_name= new datatype[row][column]|
|Representation|Represent multiple data items as a list.	|Represent multiple data items as a table consisting of rows and columns.|
|Dimension	|One|Two|
|Bytes|size of(datatype of the variable of the array) * size of the array	|size of(datatype of the variable of the array)* the number of rows* the number of columns.|
