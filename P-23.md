### 23. What is inheritance in C++? Explain with an example.


Inheritance is an important feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called the base class). This promotes code reuse and hierarchical relationships between classes.


##### Types of Inheritance in C++ :- 
1. Single Inheritance  :- single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class.
2. Multiple Inheritance :- Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C++ where a class can inherit from more than one class.
3. Multilevel Inheritance :- In this type of inheritance, a derived class is created from another derived class and that derived class can be derived from a base class or any other derived class. There can be any number of levels.
4. Hierarchical Inheritance :- In this type of inheritance, more than one subclass is inherited from a single base class.
5. Hybrid Inheritance :- A combination of two or more private inheritance: Public and protected members of the base class become private in the derived class. 

##### Example :- 
```cpp 
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Person
{
private:
    string name;
    int age;
    int rollno;

public:
    Person(string _name, int _age, int _rollno)
    {
        name= _name;
        age = _age;
        rollno = _rollno;
    }

    void display()
    {
        cout << "Name : " << name <<endl; 
        cout << "Age : " << age << endl;
        cout << "Rollno : " << rollno << endl;
    }
};

class Student1 : public Person
{
private:

    string favsubject;

public:
    Student1(string _name, int _age, int _rollno,  string _favsubject) : Person(_name, _age, _rollno), favsubject(_favsubject)
    {
        _name = _name;
        _age = _age;
        _rollno = _rollno;
        _favsubject = _favsubject;
    }

    void display()
    {
        Person::display();
        cout << "subject : " << favsubject << endl;
    }
};

class student2 : public Person
{
private:

    string favsubject;

public:
    student2(string _name, int _age, int _rollno,  string _favsubject) : Person(_name, _age, _rollno), favsubject(_favsubject)
    {
        _name=_name;
        _age = _age;
        _rollno = _rollno;
        _favsubject=_favsubject;
    }

    void display()
    {
        Person::display();
        cout << "Subject : " << favsubject << endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Student1 student1("Divyehs", 18, 101, "HTML");
    student2 student2("Kishan", 24, 102, "C++");

    cout << "Student Information :- " << endl;
    student1.display();
    cout << endl;

    cout << "Student2 Information :- " << endl;
    student2.display();

    return 0; 
} 
```
