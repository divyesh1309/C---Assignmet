## 1. What are the key differences between Procedural Programming and ObjectOrientedProgramming (OOP)?


|OOP|POP|
| ------- | -------- |
|Object-oriented programming has access specifiers like private, public, protected, etc.|There is no access specifier in procedural programming.|
|Object-oriented programming provides data hiding so it is more secure.|Procedural programming does not have any proper way of hiding data so it is less secure.|
|Based on objects that encapsulate data and methods.|Based on a sequence of procedures or functions.	|
|The Object Oriented Programming follows a Bottom-Up approach.|The Procedural Programming follows a Top-Down approach.	|
|Overloading is possible in object-oriented programming.|In procedural programming, overloading is not possible.	|
|In object-oriented programming, the concept of data hiding and inheritance is used.|In procedural programming, there is no concept of data hiding and inheritance.|
|Code reusability present in object-oriented programming.|Code reusability absent in procedural programming.|
|Examples: Java, C++, Python, C#, etc.|Examples: C, Pascal, Basic, FORTRAN, etc.|
