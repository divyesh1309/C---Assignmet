### 19. How are arrays initialized in C++? Provide examples of both 1D and 2D arrays.


##### 1. Initializing 1D Arrays :-
1D arrays are declared by specifying the type, name, and size of the array. 

Syntax:
 ```cpp
 data_type array_name[size] = {value1, value2, ..., valueN};
 ```

##### 2. Initializing 2D Arrays :-
2D arrays are declared with two size parameters representing rows and columns. They are initialized using nested braces or by flattening the data into a single list.

Syntax:
```cpp
data_type array_name[rows][columns] = {
    {value1, value2, ..., valueN},
    {value1, value2, ..., valueN},
    ...
};
```

##### Example :-

```cpp
//this is 1D array
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};   

//this is 2D array
int arr[2][3] = {
        {1, 2, 3},   // First row
        {4, 5, 6}    // Second row
    };
```
