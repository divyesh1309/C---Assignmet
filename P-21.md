### 21. Explain the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.


##### concepts of OOP :-    
1. Class
2. Object
3. Encapsulation
4. Inheritance
5. Polymorphism 
6. Data Abstraction


##### 1. Class :- 
A class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. A class is like a blueprint for an object.

##### 2. Object :-
An object is an instance of a class. It is the actual entity that stores data and performs operations as defined by the class.An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data.

##### 3. Encapsulation :-
Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up data and information under a single unit. In Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.

##### 4. Inheritance :-
Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. It helps in code reusability and the addition of new features to existing code without modifying it.

##### 5. Polymorphism :-
We can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A person at the same time can have different characteristics. Ex :- A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. it's called polymorphism.

Two types of polymorphism  :-
Method Overloading : Multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.
Method Overriding : A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

##### 6. Data Abstraction :-
Abstraction is the principle of hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary features or methods. It helps to simplify the interaction with complex systems. This concept extends to functions within a programming context, where a function can be used without knowledge of its internal workings.
